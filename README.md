# Aylesbury Vale Website
## How to open and use using the subdomain I have used:

Below is the link to my webiste which I have attached to a custom subdomain (didn't choose the actual domain)
--> 

## Alternatively, how to open and use using VS Code:

1. To open the website correctly I would recommend using the VS Code extension 'Live Server' which is found at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
2. To use it you need to install the extension then follow the instructions which are provided on the same page as the extension
3. Then open the folder using VS Code and in the bottom right hand corner there will be a button called 'Go Live'
4. Click that and it should automatically open up the website
5. If the website doesn't look like there is any CSS then just reload the page or press F5
